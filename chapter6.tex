\section{Communicating with Channels}

\texttt{Channel} is an interface for performing I/O operations. It represents the principal abstraction used by the middleware to communicate with hardware devices and external software services. The \texttt{Channel} interface is not tied to any specific technology or communication stack; as a result of this design choice, a wide variety of data management tasks, including but not limited to networking, file handling, and automatic data generation can be implemented as \texttt{Channel}s.

The current middleware architecture encourages the creation of several highly specialized \texttt{Channel}s, which are usually developed around a third-party communication library. The \texttt{HTTPChannel}, a \texttt{Channel} providing support for HTTP communications, is an excellent example of this design strategy; implemented as a simple wrapper around Apache's HTTPComponents toolkit, its development only required a basic understanding of the HTTP protocol, yet this \texttt{Channel} is a fully compliant HTTP/1.1 client (see section~\ref{sec:channel.implementations} for further details).



\texttt{Channel}s are created open and ready to be used. They may be optionally closed to relinquish unused resources by invoking the \texttt{close()} method. Once closed, a \texttt{Channel} cannot be re-opened, and every subsequent attempt to perform an IO operation will fail causing a \texttt{ChannelException} to be thrown. The current state of a \texttt{Channel} can be probed through its \texttt{isClosed()} method.

Every user-initiated interaction with a \texttt{Channel} begins with the creation of an appropriate \texttt{IORequest}, an object that contains all parameters required to characterize the I/O operation being started. Different types of Channel require different types IORequests, since the parameters needed for starting an I/O operation depend upon the technical characteristics of the I/O operation itself.

Since the specific contents of an \texttt{IORequest} object vary with the type of , the middleware does not provide a universal implementation for the \texttt{IORequest} object, 


A class of \texttt{IORequest} objects is tipically designed to be used with a specific \texttt{Channel} implementation, as its contents strictly depend on the gamut of operations supported by the \texttt{Channel} by which it is supposed to be executed

Different communication tasks require different parameters to be performed successfully: an appropriate URL is needed

 A class of \texttt{IORequest} objects is tipically designed to be used with a specific \texttt{Channel} implementation, as its contents strictly depend on the gamut of operations supported by the \texttt{Channel} by which it is supposed to be executed (e.g., \texttt{HTTPIORequests} can only be processed by an \texttt{HTTPChannel}). For this reason, the middleware does not provide a default implementation is provided for the \texttt{IORequest} interface. A set of guidelines for the implementation and management of \texttt{IORequest} objects will follow in the next sections of this chapter.

\lstset{language=Java}
\begin{lstlisting}[float,floatplacement=H,caption=The Channel interface,label={lst:channel}]
public interface Channel {
	public String getId();
	
	public IOTask submit(IORequest request, IOHandler handler)
			throws ChannelException;
	
	public void setAsyncIOHandler(IOHandler handler)
			throws IllegalStateException;
			
	public boolean isClosed();
	
	public void close();		
}
\end{lstlisting}

\texttt{IORequest} objects can be submitted to a \texttt{Channel} by means of the \texttt{submit()} method. As can be seen in listing~\ref{lst:channel}, this method is a direct implementation of the asynchronous invocation paradigm introduced in section~\ref{sec:newmiddleware.async}. Calls to \texttt{submit()} are non-blocking and require the caller to specify an \texttt{IOHandler} callback object, through which data and errors will be notified once the requested operation is complete.

The status of an ongoing operation can be queried and modified with the \texttt{IOTask} object, which is returned upon submitting a new request.


\lstset{language=Java}
\begin{lstlisting}[float,floatplacement=H,caption=The IOHandler interface,label={lst:iohandler}]
public interface IOHandler {
	public void complete(IORequest request, Optional<Payload> result);
	
	public void error(IORequest request, Throwable cause);
}
\end{lstlisting}

\lstset{language=Java}
\begin{lstlisting}[float,floatplacement=H,caption=The IOTask interface,label={lst:iotask}]
public interface IOTask {
	public void cancel();
	
	public IORequest getRequest();
	
	public boolean isCancelled();
	
	public boolean isDone();
}
\end{lstlisting}







There is no limit on the number of channels used by an FPC. Complex behaviours can be implemented using different channels

ByteArrayPayload description

The new Channel structure is monolithic, in that it contains all network layers required for the communication. This is in contrast with the previous middleware architecture, where communication layers where diveded between the legacy Channel implementation and the FPC. This new structure allows better reuse of off-the-shelf libraries.
