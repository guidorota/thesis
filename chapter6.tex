\section{Communicating with Channels}

\texttt{Channel} is an interface for performing I/O operations. It represents the principal abstraction used by the middleware to communicate with hardware devices and external software services. The \texttt{Channel} interface is not tied to any specific technology or communication stack; as a result, a wide variety of I/O taks, including but not limited to networking, file management, and automatic data generation can be implemented as a \texttt{Channel}

\texttt{Channel} implementations can be used for a wide variety of I/O taks, including but not limited to networking, file management, and automatic data generation.

All \texttt{Channel}s are created open and ready to be used. They may be optionally closed to relinquish resources by invoking the \texttt{close()} method. Once closed, a \texttt{Channel} cannot be opened again, and every subsequent attempt to perform an IO operation will fail causing a \texttt{ChannelException} to be thrown. The current state of a \texttt{Channel} can be probed through its \texttt{isClosed()} method.

\lstset{language=Java}
\begin{lstlisting}[float,floatplacement=H,caption=The Channel.submit() method signature,label={lst:channel.submit}]
public IOTask submit(IORequest request, IOHandler handler)
	throws ChannelException;
\end{lstlisting}

New I/O operations are started by dispatching an \texttt{IORequest} object through the \texttt{submit()} method. As can be seen in listing~\ref{lst:channel.submit}, this method is a direct implementation of the asynchronous invocation paradigm introduced in section~\ref{sec:newmiddleware.async}. Calls to \texttt{submit()} are non-blocking and require the caller to specify an \texttt{IOHandler} callback object, through which data and errors will be notified once the requested operation is complete.

\texttt{IORequest} is an interface that identifies a generic task that can be executed by a \texttt{Channel}. 


The status of an ongoing operation can be queried and modified with the \texttt{IOTask} object, which is returned upon submitting a new request.


\lstset{language=Java}
\begin{lstlisting}[float,floatplacement=H,caption=The IOHandler interface,label={lst:iohandler}]
public interface IOHandler {
	public void complete(IORequest request, Optional<Payload> result);
	
	public void error(IORequest request, Throwable cause);
}
\end{lstlisting}





\lstset{language=Java}
\begin{lstlisting}[float,floatplacement=H,caption=The Channel interface,label={lst:channel}]
public interface Channel {
	public String getId();
	
	public IOTask submit(IORequest request, IOHandler handler)
			throws ChannelException;
	
	public void setAsyncIOHandler(IOHandler handler)
			throws IllegalStateException;
			
	public boolean isClosed();
	
	public void close();		
}
\end{lstlisting}









There is no limit on the number of channels used by an FPC. Complex behaviours can be implemented using different channels

ByteArrayPayload description

The new Channel structure is monolithic, in that it contains all network layers required for the communication. This is in contrast with the previous middleware architecture, where communication layers where diveded between the legacy Channel implementation and the FPC. This new structure allows better reuse of off-the-shelf libraries.
