\section{Communicating with Channels}

\texttt{Channel} is an interface for performing I/O operations. It represents the principal abstraction used by the middleware to communicate with hardware devices and external software services.

The \texttt{Channel} interface is not tied to any specific technology or communication stack; as a result of this design choice, a wide variety of data management tasks, including but not limited to, networking, file handling, and automatic data generation can be implemented as \texttt{Channel}s.

The current middleware architecture encourages the creation of several highly specialized \texttt{Channel}s, which are usually developed around third-party communication libraries. \texttt{HTTPChannel}, a \texttt{Channel} providing support for HTTP communications, is an excellent example of the advantages of this design strategy. Implemented as a simple wrapper around Apache's HTTP Components toolkit, its development only required a basic understanding of the HTTP protocol; yet \texttt{HTTPChannel} is a fully compliant HTTP/1.1 client (see section~\ref{sec:channel.implementations} for additional details).

Upon instantiation, \texttt{Channel}s are open and ready to be used. They may be optionally closed to relinquish unused resources by invoking the \texttt{close()} method. Once closed, a \texttt{Channel} cannot be re-opened, and every subsequent attempt to perform an I/O operation will fail causing a \texttt{ChannelException} to be thrown. The current state of a \texttt{Channel} can be probed through its \texttt{isClosed()} method.

\lstset{language=Java}
\begin{lstlisting}[float,floatplacement=H,caption=The Channel interface,label={lst:channel}]
public interface Channel {
	public String getId();
	
	public IOTask submit(IORequest request, IOHandler handler)
			throws ChannelException;
	
	public void setAsyncIOHandler(IOHandler handler)
			throws IllegalStateException;
			
	public boolean isClosed();
	
	public void close();		
}
\end{lstlisting}

All user-initiated I/O operations begin with an invocation of the \texttt{submit()} method. As can be seen in listing~\ref{lst:channel}, \texttt{submit()} is a direct implementation of the asynchronous interaction paradigm introduced in section~\ref{sec:newmiddleware.async}.

The emphasis on asynchronous execution is underscored by the absence of blocking operations in the \texttt{Channel} interface. This aspect is of paramount importance for the entire Middleware design, as implementing a truly asynchronous system would prove impossible if such feature were not provided by its core data access layer.


\section{Instantiating Channels}

Creation of new \texttt{Channel}s is performed by means of the  \texttt{ChannelFactory} interface, a reification of the Factory design pattern that allows polymorphic instantiation of object classes.

By using the Factory instantiation model, the choice of a particular \texttt{Channel} implementation can be postponed from compile time to run time. This technique allows the Middleware to dynamically adapt in response to environment changes, and to support extension through the addition of new user-defined \texttt{Channel}s. For further information regarding the Factory pattern and its uses inside the PerLa Middleware, refer to section~\ref{sec:newmiddleware.factory}.

\lstset{language=Java}
\begin{lstlisting}[float,floatplacement=H,caption=The ChannelFactory interface,label={lst:channelFactory}]
public interface ChannelFactory {
	public Class<? extends ChannelDescriptor>
			acceptedChannelDescriptorClass();

	public Channel createChannel(ChannelDescriptor descriptor)
			throws InvalidDeviceDescriptorException;

}
\end{lstlisting}

All data required to create a new \texttt{Channel} must be stored inside a \texttt{ChannelDescriptor}. As shown in listing~\ref{lst:channelFactory}, this configuration object is the only parameter required to correctly invoke the \texttt{createChannel()} method.

\begin{figure}[h!]
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{imgs/channel_factory.eps}
\caption{Class diagram of the Channel layer}
\end{figure}

Each \texttt{ChannelFactory} is tied to a specific communication technology; therefore, it can only accept a single class of \texttt{ChannelDescriptor} objects. For example, the \texttt{HTTPChannelFactory} parses \texttt{HTTPChannelDescriptor}s and creates \texttt{HTTPChannel}s, whereas the hypothetical \texttt{SerialChannelFactory} would consume \texttt{SerialChannelDescriptor}s to create \texttt{SerialChannel}s. Failure to provide a suitable \texttt{ChannelDescriptor} object will cause the \texttt{createChannel()} method to throw an \texttt{InvalidDeviceDescriptorException}.

The \texttt{ChannelDescriptor} type supported by a \texttt{ChannelFactory} can be queried with the \texttt{acceptedChannelDescriptorClass()} method. This dynamic discovery mechanism is the fulcrum of the plugin system, as it allows the Middleware to invoke the most appropriate \texttt{ChannelFactory} using only information available at runtime.

\begin{figure}[h!]
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{imgs/channel_creation_process.eps}
\caption{The Channel creation process}
\label{fig:channel.creation}
{
\begin{footnotesize}
\begin{enumerate}
  \item JAXB binds the XML Device Descriptor to an apropriate \texttt{ChannelDescriptor} object using namespace information
  \item A suitable \texttt{ChannelFactory} is selected at runtime using the \texttt{acceptedChannelDescriptorClass()} method
  \item The information contained in the \texttt{SerialChannelDescriptor} is used to create a new \texttt{SerialChannel}
\end{enumerate}
\end{footnotesize}
}
\end{figure}

\texttt{ChannelDescriptor} objects are automatically instantiated by the Middleware using the information contained in the Device Descriptor XML files. This binding process is automatically performed by the JAXB library, which is also responsible for instantiating the correct \texttt{ChannelDescriptor} class using XML Namespace information. Figure~\ref{fig:channel.creation} provides a visual example of this technique, and ties it together with the other operations described in this section.

It is important to note that a single JVM instance running the PerLa Middleware may host several \texttt{Channel} objects of the same type, at the same time. Several devices can use the same communication technology, and the \texttt{ChannelFactory} may determine that it's best to create an individual \texttt{Channel} for each one of them. This behaviour is fostered by the new \texttt{ChannelFactory} architecture, and is considered idiomatic design; hence, it would not be uncommon to implement the hypothetical \texttt{SerialChannelFactory} introduced in the previous paragraphs so that every serial port is handled by a different \texttt{SerialChannel} instance.


\subsection{IORequest management}

\texttt{IORequest} is the base object interface employed to interact with a device connected to the Middleware. It contains two types of information: payload data to be transferred, and \texttt{Channel}-dependent parameters needed for a correct communication with the endpoint device.

Since different communication technologies require different parameters to provide end-to-end connectivity, every \texttt{Channel} is bundled with one or more custom \texttt{IORequest} classes. Following up on previous examples, at least one \texttt{SerialIORequest} should be made available with the fictitious \texttt{SerialChannel} implementation.

As shown in listing~\ref{lst:iorequest}, payload data can be set by means of the generic \texttt{setParameter()} method. \texttt{Payload} parameters are addressed by name, and a single \texttt{IORequest} implementation may support several at once. The exact set of \texttt{Payload}s accepted by a specific \texttt{IORequest} class depends on the design of the associated \texttt{Channel}. For example, the \texttt{HTTPChannel} implementation provided with the Middleware supports two: `entity' payloads (e.g., a JSON or XML message sent as request body) and `query' payloads (usually an URL-encoded string).

\lstset{language=Java}
\begin{lstlisting}[float,floatplacement=H,caption=The IORequest interface,label={lst:iorequest}]
public interface IORequest {
	public String getId();

	public void setParameter(String name, Payload payload);
}
\end{lstlisting}

\texttt{IORequest}s are disposable objects; they are created, configured, submitted to a \texttt{Channel} and garbage collected by the JVM once the communication is over. Creation is performed by means of a templating interface dubbed \texttt{IORequestBuilder}. 

iorequestbuilder parameterized with default values, then used to create new, identical iorequest objects that only need to be populated with the actual payload that has to be sent to the endpoint node


IORequestBuilder is a class for constructing new IORequest following a pattern given in the XML Device Descriptor. This is necessary since a single request may have to be used several times during the lifecycle of a device (e.g., query multiple times the same server, starting and stopping a sampling operation based on current active user queries.

Once an IORequestBuilder is created, it can be used several times to create new requests.

IORequestBuilders are created by an IORequestBuilderFactory, which takes an IORequestDescriptor object and uses it to parameterize the IORequestBuilder.


Once an IORequest is created, it can be parameterized with one or more Payloads. The entity of these payloads depends on the underlying Channel technology (HTTP body, etc). Should I introduce the Payload concept in the introductory section?






Every user-initiated interaction with a \texttt{Channel} begins with the creation of an appropriate \texttt{IORequest}, an object that contains all parameters required to characterize the I/O operation being started. Different \texttt{Channel}s require different \texttt{IORequest}s, since the parameters needed for starting an I/O operation depend upon the technical characteristics of the I/O operation itself.

\subsection{Handling asynchronous I/O operations}


The outcome of an I/O operation are collected through the \texttt{IOHandler} passed as parameter to the \texttt{submit()} method. 

\texttt{submit()} requires the caller to specify an \texttt{IOHandler} callback object, through which data and errors will be notified once the requested operation is complete.

The execution of an ongoing I/O operations can be monitored and altered using the \texttt{IOTask} object returned

 A class of \texttt{IORequest} objects is tipically designed to be used with a specific \texttt{Channel} implementation, as its contents strictly depend on the gamut of operations supported by the \texttt{Channel} by which it is supposed to be executed (e.g., \texttt{HTTPIORequests} can only be processed by an \texttt{HTTPChannel}). For this reason, the middleware does not provide a default implementation is provided for the \texttt{IORequest} interface. A set of guidelines for the implementation and management of \texttt{IORequest} objects will follow in the next sections of this chapter.

\texttt{IORequest} objects can be submitted to a \texttt{Channel} by means of the \texttt{submit()} method. As can be seen in listing~\ref{lst:channel}, this method is a direct implementation of the asynchronous invocation paradigm introduced in section~\ref{sec:newmiddleware.async}. Calls to \texttt{submit()} are non-blocking and require the caller to specify an \texttt{IOHandler} callback object, through which data and errors will be notified once the requested operation is complete.

The status of an ongoing operation can be queried and modified with the \texttt{IOTask} object, which is returned upon submitting a new request.

public interface IOHandler {
	public void complete(IORequest request, Optional<Payload> result);
	
	public void error(IORequest request, Throwable cause);
}
\end{lstlisting}

\lstset{language=Java}
\begin{lstlisting}[float,floatplacement=H,caption=The IOTask interface,label={lst:iotask}]

There is no limit on the number of channels used by an FPC. Complex behaviours can be implemented using different channels

The new Channel structure is monolithic, in that it contains all network layers required for the communication. This is in contrast with the previous middleware architecture, where communication layers where diveded between the legacy Channel implementation and the FPC. This new structure allows better reuse of off-the-shelf libraries.
